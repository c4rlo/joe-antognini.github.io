There are many ways to give bad talks, but one guaranteed way to make your
talk worse is to add a "Thank You" slide at the end.  You know the one ---
the big slide that says nothing but "Thank you" that you leave up after
you've finished your talk.

Don't do it.  There's no point.  It is a complete waste of a slide.  You
have just spent 15, 20, 30 minutes, maybe even an hour, describing to your
audience all the amazing research you have done.  In fact, you have done so
many amazing things that it will be hard for your audience to remember all
of them, so you remind them with a conclusions slide to summarize all of
your great work.  

Since there will typically be at least a few minutes for questions at the
end of a talk, if you leave your conclusions slide up, this has the
wonderful consequence that your audience will have several minutes to stare
at your conclusions slide, so that all of your results can be impressed in
their memory!  In fact, one of the points on your conclusions slide may even
remind them of a question they had to ask you!  But if you put up a "Thank
you" slide at the end of your talk, that opportunity is lost.  If you must,
you can put a "Thank you" at the bottom of your conclusions slide.  But even
with that you'd really be better off without it.  

That's all I have.  Thank you.
