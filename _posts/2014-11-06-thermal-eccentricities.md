One of the most beautiful results in dynamics is the thermal eccentricity
distribution.  Suppose we have a population of binaries which has, in some
sense, "thermalized."  That is, these binaries have all interacted with each
other and exchanged energy many times and have reached statistical
equilibrium.  We would like to know what these binaries look like.
eccentricities is.  

Now it is clear from the outset that the problem as we have posed it has a
few problems.  



This result is originally due to Jeans, known already for another great
swindle.
