## The Song of Urania podcast

I host a podcast called the [Song of Urania](https://songofurania.com) about
the history of astronomy from antiquity to the present.  I put out new episodes
every full moon.  The Song of Urania is available on Apple, Google, Spotify,
Stitcher and other podcast apps, or you can subscribe to the RSS feed directly
using [this link](https://songofurania.com/rss).

## Liturgical calendar

I developed a public webcalendar for the Traditional Latin Mass (sometimes
called the Tridentine mass) that follows the 1962 rubrics.  You can subscribe
to the calendar in Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Yahoo Calendar, or other
calendar apps.  You can find more information at the [project
page](/tridentine-calendar).
