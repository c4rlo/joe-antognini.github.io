If you use any electronic calendar application (Google Calendar, iCalendar, Yahoo Calendar,
etc.), you can subscribe to the public calendar below to add feast dates to your calendar.  This
calendar was marked using the 1962 Roman Catholic rubrics.

Each feast comes with links to additional information about the feast, saint (if applicable), and
season.  When two feasts conflict, the lower-ranking feast is prepended with a '›' so you know which
takes precedence.  Some other commonly observed non-liturgical events like Plough Monday and Mardi Gras
are also included and are prepended with a '»'.

Here is a preview of the calendar:
