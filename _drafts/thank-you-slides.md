There are many ways to give bad talks, but one guaranteed way to make your
talk worse than it would have otherwise been is to add a "Thank You" slide
at the end.  A big slide that says nothing but "Thank you" that you leave up
during the questions session.

Don't do it.  There's no point.  It is a complete waste of a slide.  You
have just spent 15, 20, 30 minutes, maybe even an hour, describing to your
audience all the amazing things you have done.  Hopefully that is a lot of
amazing things.  There are so many amazing things you have done that it may
be hard for your audience to remember all of them, so you remind them with a
conclusions slide to summarize all of your great work.  

Typically there will be at least a few minutes for questions at the end of a
talk.  If you leave your conclusions slide up, your audience will have
several minutes to stare at your conclusions slide, so that all of your
results can be impressed in their memory!  One of your conclusions may even
remind them of a question they had to ask you!  But if you put up a "Thank
you" slide at the end of your talk, that opportunity is lost.  If you must,
you can put a "Thank you" at the bottom of your conclusions slide.  But even
with that you'd really be better off without it.  

That's all I have.  Thank you.
