In our look at [Jeans's 1919 paper][1] we [derived][2] the eccentricity
distribution of a population of thermalized binaries.  Recall that we
assumed that the binaries obeyed equipartition of energy and then derived
that the eccentricity distribution must follow the law

$$f(e) = 2e \: de.$$

After deriving this law, Jeans compared the eccentricity distribution of
known binaries to it and did not find a satisfactory fit.  This led him to
conclude in his 1919 paper that binaries had not existed long enough to be
thermalized.

By the 1930s Jeans's and others' opinion had changed.  (todo)  This was
leading Jeans and other astronomers to conclude that binaries had existed
long enough to be thermalized.

The Soviet-Armenian astronomer Victor Ambartsumian published a paper in
1937, [On the Statistics of Double Stars][3] in which he pointed out an
important flaw in Jeans's reasoning.  In a nutshell, Jeans's fallacy was to
affirm the consequent.  Jeans showed that a thermalized population of
binaries should obey the above eccentricity distribution and argued that
because this distribution is observed, binaries must be thermalized.  But
Ambartsumian demonstrated that the above eccentricity distribution will be
produced under a wide variety of conditions, so it does not follow that the
population of binaries has thermalized if the thermal eccentricity
distribution is observed. 

### Deriving the eccentricity distribution the easy way

In our post on Jeans's paper we took a somewhat intuitive, but nevertheless
long path to derive the simple thermal eccentricity distribution.
Ambartsumian discovered a much simpler and more general distribution.
