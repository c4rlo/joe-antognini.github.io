## Onset

Sunday, February 10, 2019 began as a wonderful day.  I showered in the morning
and I distinctly remember feeling well rested and all around quite good.  But as
I was drying off I felt a sharp pain in my upper back like I had pulled a muscle
or pinched a nerve.

I started to suspect that something was amiss as my wife and I walked to mass
that morning.  Our church is down a pretty steep hill from our apartment, so
getting there is normally easy, but I was needing to walk pretty slowly.  By
coincidence my wife had gone to the gym for the first time after a break, so her
legs were pretty sore and we both sort of hobbled to mass together.  On the way
back up the hill I was able to (slowly) make it back to the apartment, but I had
to stop to catch my breath, which I never had to do.

Over the course of the day I found that I had trouble taking deep breaths.  I
was reading the Decameron at the time, so to test myself I would try reading a
passage to my wife, but I usually wasn't able to make it through an entire
sentence.  I didn't really feel like moving very much, but apart from that and
the fact that I couldn't take a full breath, I felt fine.  Nevertheless, that
evening I made a doctor's appointment.  Fortunately there was an opening early
the next morning.  *Note: If you have symptoms where you're having trouble
breathing and can't take a full breath, don't do what I did.  Go straight to the
emergency room!* 

By nighttime I was starting to feel pretty crappy.  It was too painful to lay on
my back or my left side, so I went to sleep laying on my right side.  But after
a while that started to become painful, too, so I moved to the couch and slept
for a while sitting up.  I ended up alternating between sleeping for a bit
sitting up and going back to bed to lay on my right side.

## At the doctor

The following morning I felt completely miserable.  I somehow managed to take a
shower (my last for more than a week as it would turn out), but it was too
painful to bend over so I had a hard time drying my legs.  With some careful
gymnastics I managed to put on my pants, but I couldn't put my shoes on so I
left in my slippers instead.  I booked a Lyft and took slow, uncomfortable
journey through the heavy San Francisco Monday morning traffic to the hospital.

When I arrived the nurse took my vitals and then the doctor came to see me.  I
told her that I was having trouble taking deep breaths and had a lot of pain
when I bent over or lay on my back or left side.  She said, "It sounds like
you're having trouble breathing!"  She listened to my lungs and said that there
was definitely an issue with my left lung and there was possibly some fluid in
it.  She sent me to get an X-ray and told me that she was going to call the
emergency doctor in the meantime.

I hobbled on over to the floor with the radiology department to get my X-ray,
and after about twenty minutes or so hobbled on back to the original room.  (I
was actually carrying my laptop bag with me at the time because I was under some
delusion, maybe born out of hopefulness that my condition wasn't actually all
that serious, that I was going to go in to work after my appointment.)  After a
few minutes my doctor came back and said, "So... we're going to call 911."  She
told me that my left lung had collapsed, and then a few minutes later introduced
me to the emergeency doctor and two SFFD paramedics who were going to take me to
the emergency room at a hospital across town by ambulance.  The paramedics had
brought a guerney with them, but I told them I felt well enough to walk down to
the ambulance (after all, I had just walked to get my X-ray!), but they told me
that under no circumstances was I going to walk myself.  I told them that under
no circumstances was I going to lay down in the guerney because it would be
incredibly painful, but fortunately it was fancy enough to transform into an
upright seated position and they wheeled me out into the ambulance that way..

The ambulance ride itself was fairly uneventful.  I had never been in an
ambulance before so I made some small talk with the paramedics in the back with
me, and tried to ignore my heart rate approaching 130 bpm.  Although my
condition was serious, it evidently wasn't serious enough to warrent turning on
the sirens.  I do remember, however, that as we pulled in to the hospital there
was a pretty big bump as we drove onto the driveway to the emergency room and I
remember thinking how that bump must have added some unnecessary pain to a lot
of people who were already in serious pain.

### So what is a spontaneous pneumothorax, anyway?

Before getting into more details about my experience I should go
into a little more detail about what exactly a spontaneous pneumothorax is.  I
didn't get all this information until a few days later, but I got some of it in
the emergency room so now is as good a time as any for a short primer on the
condition.

A pneumothorax is simply a medical condition where there is air in the chest
cavity (and outside the lung).  A spontaneous pneumothorax is a pneumothorax
that happens, well, spontaneously, with no obvious reason as to what caused it.
By contrast pneumothorax in general can be caused by lots of things that you
would definitely think would give you a pneumothorax like getting stabbed in the
chest or being in a car accident.

Spontaneous pneumothorax cases broadly tend to fall into two groups.  The first
group consists of people with certain genetic disorders which predispose them to
spontaneous pneumothorax.  The most common of these is Marfan's Syndrome, which
results in unusually elastic tissue.  This elasticity seems to predispose the
lung tissue to rupture and produce a pneumothorax.  The other group consists of
everyone else --- people who are otherwise normal and healthy, but end up with a
collapsed lung anyway.  Of this group, the largest demographic is thin, tall men
between the ages of twenty and forty.  (In my particular case, while I'm of
average height at best, I do meet the other criteria.)  From what I can tell it
doesn't seem to be well known what predisposes this demographic to be
susceptible to spontaneous pneumothorax.  One can speculate that being tall and
thin tends to stretch out the lung tissue more, maybe making it thinner and more
likely to rupture, but I don't think there's any concrete evidence to support
that speculation.

So how does the spontaneous pneumothorax actually happen?  It turns out that the
lung can sometimes have little bliser-like bubbles on them called blebs.  Based
on autopsies, blebs seem to be somewhat common and tend to form towards the top
of the lung.  In rare cases (like mine), the bleb can pop, and then air leaks
from the lung into the chest cavity.  Once air starts to leak into the chest
cavity, there's no longer a pressure differential between the lung and the rest
of the chest.  This means that when the diaphragm contracts, the chest cavity
will expand as normal, but this expansion will just suck air through the rupture
and into the chest cavity; the lung won't inflate (or at least it won't inflate
as much).  This picture is a bit simplified, however, because sometimes a bleb
can pop and there can be a partial collapse, but it can resolve itself.

A pneumothorax is very dangerous.  I was lucky because only a single lung
collapsed, so I could still breathe, albeit shallowly.  But if one lung
completely collapses, it's only a matter of time before it causes the other lung
to collapse as well.  Once both lungs collapse you can't breathe at all and will
quickly die if left untreated.  Another danger is that the collapsed lung can
impinge upon the heart or aorta and lead to cardiac arrest.  So if you have
trouble breathing, really, get treated right away.

Fortunately the immediate treatment for a pneumothorax is simple --- the nurse
will insert a tube into your chest, attach it to a suction pump, and pump the
air out of your chest cavity.  With the air out of your chest cavity, the
pressure differential between the lung and the chest cavity is restored, your
lung will expand normally when your diaphragm contracts, and you can breathe
normally again.  In many cases this is all that is required.  If the suction is
kept on for a while to ensure the lung stays expanded, the lung will often heal
itself and stay inflated once the chest tube is removed (at least for a while).

## Emergency room

The ambulance had phoned ahead to the emergency room, so as soon as I arrived at
the hospital I changed into a hospital gown, was transferred to a bed (which
thankfully could be adjusted into an almost-sitting position), and was given an
oxygen mask.

While I was in the ambulance I had texted my wife that I was on my way to the
emergency room.  She was working at Google at the time and fortunately was able
to take advantage of their emergency ride program to get a ride from Mountain
View to San Francisco.  In the meantime she had texted my parents that I was in
the emergency room and they arrived about fifteen minutes after I did, and my wife
arrived about thirty minutes after that.

Not too long after my wife had arrived they started to go ahead with inserting
the chest tube.  One of the nurses kindly shaved the hair off the left side of
my chest.  They then inserted the tube somewhere midway up my left breast.  A
lot of people complain about the pain of chest tubes, but I don't remember
feeling this one at all.  That changed, however, when they turned on the
suction.  With the suction on, my lung started to reinflate, incredibly
uncomfortably.  Although the point of the chest tube is to get your lung
inflated so you can breathe again, when they turned the suction I had an
overwhelming sensation of being unable to breathe at all.  Even when the nurses
put the suction on the lowest setting, I felt like a fish pulled out of water.
It was so uncomfortable (even if not exactly painful), that they stopped three
times so I could catch my breath as my lung expanded.  

## Surgery

Once a chest tube is in and the lung is reinflated, the usual treatment for a
spontaneous pneumothorax is to just wait a while to see if the lung can heal
itself.  So, I was wheeled to a hospital room, and every now and again a nurse
would disconnect my chest tube from suction, and then they'd wait a few hours
and take a chest X-ray to see if my lung would stay up on its own.  They did
this for three days, but every time I was taken off suction my lung collapsed
again.  This was probably exacerbated by the fact that my lunge had completely
collapsed.  If I had gone to the emergency room immediately the chest tube may
have been enough.

In some ways the fact that my lung kept collapsing may have been a good thing,
because it meant that I was eligible for a pleurodesis.  While it's nice if your
lung heals itself, if you've had a spontaneous pneumothorax, the odds that the
lung will collapse again are about 80%.  A pleurodesis, however, provides a more
permanent solution.

That said, the pleurodesis is not a fun surgery.  My surgeon put it quite
diplomatically by saying that "it is a procedure that is not without pain."  The
pleurodesis is typically preceded by a "blebectomy", where the surgeon removes
the portion of the lung with the ruptured bleb (and possibly other blebs in the
area).  The lung is then stapled shut with a titanium surgical staple.  After
that the pleurodesis begins.  The lung is first stripped of a thin lining of
outer tissue, called the pleura.  Then the lung is scarred by scrubbing it with
what is essentially steel wool  (this is known as mechanical pleurodesis).
Finally the surgeon uses a chemical to further scar the lung (this is known as
chemical pleurodesis).  In my case the surgeon used doxycycline as the scarring
agent, although this varies.  (From what I understand talc is most commonly used
and is more potent than doxycycline.  As I explain later this has advantages and
disadvantages.  Sometimes surgeons will also just do a mechanical pleurodesis or
a chemical pleurodesis.)  The steel wool and doxycycline all cause the lung to
scar.  The idea behind this procedure is that this scar tissue will then grow
between the lung and the chest wall.  This way if another bleb ruptures, the
scar tissue can keep the rest of the lung up.

In the past this procedure was a little more gruesome because the surgeon would
have to pry apart two ribs to get to the lung.  Thankfully these days the
surgery is much less invasive; in my case I had five small incisions, three
midway down my left side, one just under my armpit, and one on my back, each one
about three-quarters of an inch long.  The surgeon then sticks a robotic snake
through these incisions to perform the surgery.

Nevertheless, thoracic surgery of any kind is no joke.  The body keeps a lot of
its important parts there, so while there are risks associated with any surgery,
there are more risks associated with thoracic surgery than usual.

### The downsides of pleurodesis

For an otherwise healthy adult, a pleurodesis is a relatively safe procedure.
In the words of my surgeon, "there are no home runs, but on a scale of 1 to 10,
a pleurodesis is a 1."  Given that there is a 20% chance that an individual who
has had a spontaneous pneumothorax on one lung will have a spontaneous
pneumothorax on the other, why don't the doctors just perform a pleurodesis on
both lungs while they're at it?

The first reason is that although the surgery is relatively safe, it's still
extremely painful.  After the surgery I wasn't able to sleep on my left side for
about three months, and I still have pain today if I sleep on that side for too
long.  Being able to lie down on my right side made my recovery much easier.

The other reason is that if you need to have lung surgery later in life (say,
you develop lung cancer), the pleurodesis makes those future surgeries much more
dangerous.  The scar tissue that is keeping the lung up makes it very difficult
for the surgeon to isolate the part of the lung they want to operate on and so
any surgery becomes a much more delicate procedure.

### A digression in support of opioids

One of the things that happens to you when you have a spontaneous pneumothorax
is that you take a lot of opioids.  Over the course of my recovery I became
quite familiar with the different kinds and their effects: morphine, oxycontin,
norco, diluadid, fentanyl, percocet.  I had them all.

The surprising thing to me about the opioids was that they didn't actually
noticeably reduce my pain.  I suppose the surgery was so painful that I would
have had to have been drugged out of my mind to completely eliminate the pain.
Nevertheless, opioids were a critical part of my recovery because even though I
was still in a lot of pain, they actually *doubled* the volume of air I was able
to breathe.

This turns out to be critical for the recovery process.  The idea of the
pleurodesis is that the surgeon thoroughly scars the lung and then the scar
tissue grows betnween the lung and the chest wall to hold the lung up the next
time a collapse happens.  But in order to get the scar tissue to grow to the
chest wall the lung needs to be pressed up against the chest wall, which means
that taking in deep breaths is crucial.  As you might imagine, having your lung
scrubbed with steel wool and scarred with doxycycline does not exactly make it
easy to take deep breaths.  Nevertheless, after the surgery I was told to
breathe as deeply as I could every six minutes.

To help you out with this, the hospital will give you a little plastic device to
keep called an incentive spirometer.  The incentive spirometer is a graduated
cylinder with a floating disk and a tube attached.  By breathing into it you can
measure how much air you can inhale.  I noticed that before receiving a dose of
opioids, I would only be able to breathe about 750 mL of air,  But after my next
dose kicked in I would be breathing 1500 mL.  After the does had worn off four
hours later I would be back to breathing 750 mL.  For context, an avearge adult
male can breathe around 4000 mL.  (I never had need to use a spirometer before
my pneumothorax, so I unfortunately don't know what my personal baseline was
before my lung collapsed.)

Without opioids I would not have been able to breathe as deeply as I needed to
to successfully recover from the surgery.  Even still, I wouldn't be able to
breathe very deeply in the last hour before the next four hour dose.  Sometimes
the hospital would give me Tylenol to help tide me over between doses, but I
never noticed the Tylenol making any difference.

Interestingly, there is one class of medications that would have be extremely
effective at relieving my pain: NSAIDs like Ibuprofin, Advil, and Motrin.  As
the full name implies NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) are quite
good at reducing inflammation.  Unfortunately that is counter-productive in this
case.  In a pleurodesis we *want* inflammation!  Inflaming the tissue is the
whole point so that we can grow scar tissue!  So NSAIDs are great at relieving
the pain from a pleurodesis, but defeat the entire purpose of the operation, so
you're not allowed to have them for several weeks after this surgery.

Of the opioids I was given Norco was by far the best.  Percocet was not too bad,
but not as effective for me as Norco was.  The worst was Diluadid, which I was
given once and made me nauseous to the point of vomiting.

## After surgery

Going into surgery I had one tube sticking out of my chest, but when I woke up
I discovered I now had two.  This second tube was a little grosser than the
first because it was a drainage tube.  Instead of sticking out of the front of
my chest, it was sticking out from my left side.  It was about two feet long and
had a little bulb at the end to collect blood and other fluids.

As before, the first tube was providing suction to keep my lung up while the
scar tisuse began to form.  This tube passed through a little box with some sort
of a water lock in it.  Since blood would make its way through the first tube,
the box would collect the excess fluid so it didn't get sucked into the
hospital's network of peunmatic tubes.  Additionally the water lock would bubble
when air was being sucked out of my chest.  After the surgery, the hope was that
the suction box would stop bubbling because the ruptured bleb would have been
removed and the hole in my lung would have been stapled up.  Sadly, one day
later as I was laying the hospital bed down to go to sleep I heard the bubbling
start again.  I didn't realize it at the time, but it is apparently fairly
common for the leak to continue a little while after the surgery since it takes
a day or two for the stapled seam to heal and become airtight.  Fortunately, by
morning the bubbling had stopped.  One of the residents took me off of suction
and we waited a few hours, took an X-ray, and verified that the lung was staying
up.

(Incidentally I had a *lot* of chest X-rays over my week in the hospital,
probably somewhere around 20.  I quickly learned that I have "long lungs" and a
normal X-ray wouldn't catch the bottoms of my lungs.  If I forgot to tell the
technician they'd have to redo the X-ray.  One of the technicians joked that
after I was done with all this I would glow in the dark.  I looked up the
radiation dosage from a chest X-ray, and fortuantely it takes on the order of
25,000 chest X-rays before you have a substantially increased chance of cancer.
By comparison, it only takes 25 CAT scans.)

At this point I could be discharged from the hospital and go home.  Before I
could go they had to remove the chest tube that had been providing suction.  One
of the residents told me to take a deep breath, hunker down, and hum as loudly
as I could and then he yanked it out.  (This was essentially performing a
Valsalva manuveur.)  Once it was out I was sent on my way, although I still had
the drainage tube sticking out of my side.  That was to be removed a week later.

## Recovery

The week that I had my drainage tube after surgery was quite painful.  I didn't
know it at the time, but the tube wraps through the chest cavity and is perhaps
a foot and a half long.  The tube rubs against parts of the body that normally
not have plastic tubes rubbing against them, so it creates pain, but the brain
doesn't know how to correctly interpret the pain.  This produces a sensation of
upper back pain in very specific spots, known as "referred pain".  During this
time it was too painful to lie down so my wife and I created an enormous mound
of pillows on the bed so I could sleep sitting up.

A week later I went back to the hospital to have the drainage tube removed.  As
with the other chest tube, I had to take a deep breath in and hunker down while
the resident yanked the tube out of me.  The drainage tube was longer than the
original chest tube and I think some scar tissue had started to grow around it,
so removing it was easily the worst pain in the entire ordeal.

Once all the tubes were out of my body I felt much better.  I still couldn't lie
down, but I at least didn't have terrible back pain anymore.  My tube was
removed on a Friday so I went back to work on the following Monday.  I was out
for a total of two weeks, one in the hospital, and one recovering at home.  I
was instructed not to carry anything heavier than five pounds for the six weeks
after my surgery.

The recovery process was fairly slow.



* Removing the drainage tube
* Sleeping
* Referred pain
* Carrying heavy objects
* Bandages used
* Pleural friction rub
* Clutching rib during coughing and sneezing
* Going back to work
* Trachea feeling offset
* Persistent cough
* Spasms in chest
* Paranoia

Today I can easily breathe over 3000 mL on my spirometer, and 

As I type the last bit of this post out I'm currently on an airplane somewhere
over the middle of Greenland, flying back to San Francisco from England.  One of
the more delicate questions in recovering from a spontaneous pneumothorax is
when you can fly again.  Even in a pressurized cabin, the air pressure during a
flight is much lower than normal atmospheric pressure (perhaps 75% or so), and
the change happens quickly --- all reicpes for a reccurence.  In the past
doctors were fairly conservative and recommended waiting six months to a year
before flying again.  But my doctor told me that these days after a pleurodesis
the chance of having a recurrence during an airplane flight is minimal.  I don't
think he gave me a fixed time when it would be safe, but he said that after
two or three months flying would be perfectly fine.  In my case, it has now been
around ten months since my spontaneous pneumothorax.  I first flew to Rome on
the way to Interspeech a month ago (so, nine months after the pleurodesis) and
felt a little bit of tightness in my chest for the first hour of the flight, but
it may have been imagined.  On my flight back I didn't experience any pain at
all.
