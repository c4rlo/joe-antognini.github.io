## Onset

Sunday, February 10, 2019 began as a wonderful day.  I showered in the morning
and I distinctly remember feeling well rested and all around quite good.  But as
I was drying off I felt a sharp pain in my upper back like I had pulled a muscle
or pinched a nerve.

I started to suspect that something was amiss as my wife and I walked to mass
that morning.  Our church is down a pretty steep hill from our apartment, so
getting there is normally easy, but I was needing to walk pretty slowly.  By
coincidence my wife had gone to the gym for the first time after a break, so her
legs were pretty sore and we both sort of hobbled to mass together.  On the way
back up the hill I was able to (slowly) make it back to the apartment, but I had
to stop to catch my breath, which I never had to do.

Over the course of the day I found that I had trouble taking deep breaths.  I
was reading the Decameron at the time, so to test myself I would try reading a
passage to my wife, but I usually wasn't able to make it through an entire
sentence.  I didn't really feel like moving very much, but apart from that and
the fact that I couldn't take a full breath, I felt fine.  Nevertheless, that
evening I made a doctor's appointment.  Fortunately there was an opening early
the next morning.  *Note: If you have symptoms where you're having trouble
breathing and can't take a full breath, don't do what I did.  Go straight to the
emergency room!* 

By nighttime I was starting to feel pretty crappy.  It was too painful to lay on
my back or my left side, so I went to sleep laying on my right side.  But after
a while that started to become painful, too, so I moved to the couch and slept
for a while sitting up.  I ended up alternating between sleeping for a bit
sitting up and going back to bed to lay on my right side.

## At the doctor

The following morning I felt completely miserable.  I somehow managed to take a
shower (my last for more than a week as it would turn out), but it was too
painful to bend over so I had a hard time drying my legs.  With some careful
gymnastics I managed to put on my pants, but I couldn't put my shoes on so I
left in my slippers instead.  I booked a Lyft and took slow, uncomfortable
journey through the heavy San Francisco Monday morning traffic to the hospital.

When I arrived the nurse took my vitals and then the doctor came to see me.  I
told her that I was having trouble taking deep breaths and had a lot of pain
when I bent over or lay on my back or left side.  She said, "It sounds like
you're having trouble breathing!"  She listened to my lungs and said that there
was definitely an issue with my left lung and there was possibly some fluid in
it.  She sent me to get an X-ray and told me that she was going to call the
emergency doctor in the meantime.

I hobbled on over to the floor with the radiology department to get my X-ray,
and after about twenty minutes or so hobbled on back to the original room.  (I
was actually carrying my laptop bag with me at the time because I was under some
delusion, maybe born out of hopefulness that my condition wasn't actually all
that serious, that I was going to go in to work after my appointment.)  After a
few minutes my doctor came back and said, "So... we're going to call 911."  She
told me that my left lung had collapsed, and then a few minutes later introduced
me to the emergeency doctor and two SFFD paramedics who were going to take me to
the emergency room by ambulance.  The paramedics had brought
a guerney with them, but I told them I felt well enough to walk down to the
ambulance (after all, I had just walked to get my X-ray!), but they told me that
under no circumstances was I going to walk myself.  I told them that under no
circumstances was I going to lay down in the guerney because it would be
incredibly painful, but fortunately it was fancy enough to transform into an
upright seated position and they wheeled me out into the ambulance that way..

The ambulance ride itself was fairly uneventful.  I had never been in an
ambulance before so I made some small talk with the paramedics in the back with
me, and tried to ignore my heart rate approaching 130 bpm.  Although my
condition was serious, it evidently wasn't serious enough to warrent turning on
the sirens.

I was a little surprised that a doctor would have to call 911 for a medical
emergency given that I was already in a hospital!  But evidently in my condition
I needed to go to the emergency room.

### So what is a spontaneous pneumothorax, anyway?

Before getting into more details about my experience it would be useful to go
into a little more detail about what exactly a spontaneous pneumothorax is.  I
didn't get all this information until a few days later, but I got some of it in
the emergency room so now is as good a time as any for a short primer on the
condition.

A pneumothorax is simply a medical condition where there is air in the chest
cavity (and outside the lung).  A spontaneous pneumothorax is a pneumothorax
that happens, well, spontaneously, with no obvious reason as to what caused it.
By contrast pneumothorax in general can be caused by lots of things that you
would definitely think would give you a pneumothorax like getting stabbed in the
chest or being in a car accident.

Spontaneous pneumothorax cases broadly tend to fall into two groups.  The first
group consists of people with certain genetic disorders which predispose them to
spontaneous pneumothorax.  The most common of these is Marfan's Syndrome, which
results in unusually elastic tissue.  This elasticity seems to predispose the
lung tissue to rupture and produce a pneumothorax.  The other group consists of
everyone else --- people who are otherwise normal and healthy, but end up with a
collapsed lung anyway.  Of this group, the largest demographic is thin, tall men
between the ages of twenty and forty.  (In my particular case, while I'm of
average height at best, I do meet the other criteria.)  From what I can tell it
doesn't seem to be well known what predisposes this demographic to be
susceptible to spontaneous pneumothorax.  One can speculate that being tall and
thin tends to stretch out the lung tissue more, maybe making it thinner and more
likely to rupture, but I don't think there's any concrete evidence to support
that speculation.

So how does the spontaneous pneumothorax actually happen?  It turns out that the
lung can sometimes have little bliser-like bubbles on them called blebs.  Based
on autopsies, blebs seem to be somewhat common and tend to form towards the top
of the lung.  In rare cases (like mine), the bleb can pop, and then air leaks
from the lung into the chest cavity.  Once air starts to leak into the chest
cavity, there's no longer a pressure differential between the lung and the rest
of the chest.  This means that when the diaphragm contracts, the chest cavity
will expand as normal, but this expansion will just suck air through the rupture
and into the chest cavity; the lung won't inflate (or at least it won't inflate
as much).  This picture is a bit simplified, however, because sometimes a bleb
can pop and there can be a partial collapse, but it can resolve itself.

A pneumothorax can be a very dangerous event.  I was lucky because only a single
lung collapsed, so I could still breathe, albeit shallowly.  But if one lung
completely collapses, it's only a matter of time before it causes the other lung
to collapse as well.  Once both lungs collapse you can't breathe at all and will
quickly die if left untreated.  Another danger is that the collapsed lung can
impinge upon the heart or aorta and lead to cardiac arrest.  So if you have a ,
really, get treated right away.

Fortunately the immediate treatment is simple --- the nurse will insert a tube
into your chest, attach it to a suction pump, and pump the air out of your chest
cavity.  With the air out of your chest cavity, the pressure differential
between the lung and the chest cavity is restored, your lung will expand
normally when your diaphragm contracts, and you can breathe normally again.  In
many cases this is all that is required.  If the suction is kept on for a while
to ensure the lung stays expanded, the lung will often heal itself and stay
inflated once the chest tube is removed (at least for a while).

## Emergency room

The ambulance had phoned ahead to the emergency room, so as soon as I arrived at
the hospital I changed into a hospital gown, was transferred to a bed (which
thankfully could be adjusted into an almost-sitting position), and was given an
oxygen mask.

While I was in the ambulance I had texted my wife that I was on my way to the
emergency room.  She was working at Google at the time and fortunately was able
to take advantage of their emergency ride program to get a ride from Mountain
View to San Francisco.  In the meantime she had texted my parents that I was in
the emergency room and they arrived about fifteen minutes after I did, and my wife
arrived about thirty minutes after that.

Not too long after my wife had arrived they started to go ahead with inserting
the chest tube.  One of the nurses kindly shaved the hair off the left side of
my chest.  They then inserted the tube somewhere midway up my left breast.  A
lot of people complain about the pain of chest tubes, but I don't remember
feeling this one at all.  That changed, however, when they turned on the
suction.  With the suction on, my lung started to reinflate, incredibly
uncomfortably.  Although the point of the chest tube is to get your lung
inflated so you can breathe again, when they turned the suction I had an
overwhelming sensation of being unable to breathe at all.  Even when the nurses
put the suction on the lowest setting, I felt like a fish pulled out of water.
It was so uncomfortable (even if not exactly painful), that I think they stopped
three times so I could catch my breath as my lung expanded.  

## Surgery

The usual treatment for a spontaneous pneumothorax is to use a chest tube to
reinflate the lung, and then wait a while to see if the lung can heal itself.
So, I was wheeled to a hospital room, and every now and again a nurse would
disconnect my chest tube from suction, and then they'd wait a few hours and take
a chest X-ray to see if my lung would stay up on its own.  They did this for
three days, but every time I was taken off suction my lung collapsed again.
(This was probably exacerbated by the fact that my lunge had completely
collapsed.  If I had gone to the emergency room immediately the chest tube may
have been enough.)

In some ways the fact that my lung kept collapsing may have been a good thing,
because it meant that I was eligible for a pleurodesis.  While it's nice if
your lung heals itself, the odds that it will happen again are about 80%.  A
pleurodesis, however, provides a more permanent solution.

That said, the pleurodesis is not a pretty surgery.  My surgeon put it very
diplomatically by saying that "it is a procedure that is not without pani."  The
pleurodesis is typically preceded by a "blebectomy", where the surgeon removes
the portion of the lung with the ruptured bleb (and possibly other blebs in the
area).  The lung is then stapled shut with a titanium surgical staple.  After
that the pleurodesis begins.  The lung is first stripped of a thin lining of
outer tissue, called the pleura.  Then the lung is scarred by scrubbing it with
what is essentially steel wool  (this is known as mechanical pleurodesis).
Finally the surgeon uses a chemical to further scar the lung (this is known as
chemical pleurodesis).  In my case the surgeon used doxycycline as the scarring
agent, although this varies.  (From what I understand talc is most commonly used
and is more potent than doxycycline.  As I explain later this has advantages and
disadvantages.  Sometimes surgeons will also just do a mechanical pleurodesis or
a chemical pleurodesis.)  The steel wool and doxycycline all cause the lung to
scar.  The idea behind this procedure is that this scar tissue will then grow
between the lung and the chest wall.  This way if another bleb ruptures, the
scar tissue can keep the rest of the lung up.

In the past this procedure was a little more gruesome beacuse the surgeon would
have to pry apart two ribs to get to the lung.  Thankfully these days the
surgery is much less invasive; in my case I had four small incisions, three on
my left side, and one on my back, each one about three-quarters of an inch long.
The surgeon then sticks a robotic snake through these incisions to perform the
surgery.  

to Nevertheless, thoracic surgery of any kind is no joke.  The body keeps a lot of
its important parts there, so while there are risks associated with any surgery,
there are more risks associated with .


Twice a day I would
get a chest X-ray to check on the status of my lung.


### The downsides of pleurodesis

So why don't the doctors just perform a pleurodesis on both while they're at it?


### A digression in support of opioids

One of the things that happens to you when you have a spontaneous pneumothorax
is that you take a lot of opioids.  Over the course of my recovery I became
quite familiar with the different kinds and their effects: morphine, oxycontin,
diluadid, fentanyl, percocet.  I had them all.


The really interesting thing about the opioids was that they didn't actually
noticeably reduce my pain.  I suppose the surgery was so painful that I would
have had to have been drugged out of my mind to completely eliminate the pain.
But, the opioids doubled the volume of air I was able to breathe.

If you have a lung operation (or actually lots of other kinds of operations
these days), the hospital will give you a little plastic device to keep called
an incentive spirometer.  The incentive spirometer consists of a graduated
cylinder with a floating disk and a tube attached.  By breathing into the
spirometer, you can measure how much air you haev inhaled.  Before receiving a
dose of opioids, I would only be able to breathe about 750 mL of air,  But after
my next dose kicked in I would be breathing 1500 mL.  After the does had worn
off Four hours later I would be back to breathing 750 mL with each breath.  For
context, an avearge adult male can breathe around 4000 mL.  (I never had need to
use a spirometer before my pneumothorax, so I unfortunately don't know what my
personal baseline was before my lung collapsed.)

## Recovery

Today I can easily breathe over 3000 mL on my spirometer, and 

As I type the last bit of this post out I'm currently on an airplane somewhere
over the middle of Greenland, flying back to San Francisco from England.  One of
the more delicate questions in recovering from a spontaneous pneumothorax is
when you can fly again.  Even in a pressurized cabin, the air pressure during a
flight is much lower than normal atmospheric pressure (perhaps 75% or so), and
the change happens quickly --- all reicpes for a reccurence.  In the past
doctors were fairly conservative and recommended waiting six months to a year
before flying again.  But my doctor told me that these days after a pleurodesis
the chance of having a recurrence during an airplane flight is minimal.  I don't
think he gave me a fixed time when it would be safe, but he said that after
two or three months flying would be perfectly fine.  In my case, it has now been
around ten months since my spontaneous pneumothorax.  I first flew to Rome on
the way to Interspeech a month ago (so, nine months after the pleurodesis) and
felt a little bit of tightness in my chest for the first hour of the flight, but
it may have been imagined.  On my flight back I didn't experience any pain at
all.
