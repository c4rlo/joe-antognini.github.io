Among the most important results in cosmology was the discovery at the tail
end of the twentieth century of the accelerating expansion of the universe.
This result implied that around 70% of the energy density of the universe
was composed of some exotic substance given the placeholder name "dark
energy."

## A quest for two numbers

In the three decades after the discovery of the cosmic microwave background
(and with it, the verification of the big bang theory), observational
cosmology was referred to as "the quest for two numbers": the Hubble
constant and the deceleration parameter.  As it happens, both terms are
misnomers.  The Hubble constant is the rate of expansion of the universe
today and has units of 1/time (i.e., a fractional length per unit time),
although it's usually written in the more baroque, but observationally
convenient, units km/s/Mpc.  But it's inaccurate to call Hubble's constant a
constant because it changes in time.  If the universe contained only matter
(let's pretend dark energy doesn't exist), then over time the expansion of
the universe would slow down due to the gravity of the matter in the
universe.  This would mean that over time, Hubble's "constant" would get
smaller and smaller.  

It is the slowing down of the expansion of the universe that the
deceleration parameter is intended to measure.  We now know that the
expansion of the universe is speeding up rather than slowing down, so it
really should have been called the "acceleration parameter," but that wasn't
known when it was coined!

Measuring accurate values of these two numbers is an exceedingly difficult
task and much of observational cosmology of the second half of the twentieth
century was concerned with measuring reliable values for these numbers.  

Making these measurements accurately is a difficult task
