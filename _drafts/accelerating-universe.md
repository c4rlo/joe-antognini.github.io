Among the most important results in cosmology was the discovery at the tail
end of the twentieth century of the accelerating expansion of the universe.
This result implied that around 70% of the energy density of the universe
was composed of some exotic substance given the placeholder name "dark
energy."  In this note we will review the two papers that announced this
discovery: Riess et al. (1998) and Perlmutter et al. (1999). 

## A quest for two numbers

In the three decades after the discovery of the cosmic microwave background
(and with it, the verification of the big bang theory), observational
cosmology was referred to as "the quest for two numbers": the Hubble
constant and the deceleration parameter.  As it happens, both terms are
misnomers.  The Hubble constant is the rate of expansion of the universe
today and has units of 1/time (i.e., a fractional length per unit time),
although it's usually written in the more baroque, but observationally
convenient, units km/s/Mpc.  But it's inaccurate to call Hubble's constant a
constant because it changes in time.  If the universe contained only matter
(let's pretend dark energy doesn't exist), then over time the expansion of
the universe would slow down due to the gravity of the matter in the
universe.  This would mean that over time, Hubble's "constant" would get
smaller and smaller.  

It is the slowing down of the expansion of the universe that the
deceleration parameter is intended to measure.  Of course, we now know that
the expansion of the universe is speeding up rather than slowing down, so it
really should have been called the "acceleration parameter," but that wasn't
known when it was coined!

Measuring these two numbers accurately is an exceedingly difficult task and
much of observational cosmology of the second half of the twentieth century
was concerned with measuring these numbers reliably.  The essential
difficulty is that to measure these parameters one needs to measure the
distance of a number of objects and their recession velocity (that is, how
fast they are moving away from us).  The latter measurement is not so
difficult.  Most astrophysical sources exhibit absorption or emission lines
in their spectra.  Since the rest wavelength of a spectral line is known
(either from laboratory measurements or fundamental physics), the redshift
of a set of spectral lines can tell us the recession velocity quite
accurately.

The measurement of distances, however, is an entirely different matter.
Unfortunately for us astronomers, celestial objects don't come with signs on
them declaring how far away they are for us!  (Or maybe this is fortunate
--- if they did, astronomy would be much easier and we might be out of a
job!)  For decades, the hard problem of observational cosmology was
measuring accurate distances to distant objects.  To solve this problem one
requires what is known as a "standard candle."  (Sometimes a "standard
ruler" is used, but we won't go into that here.)  A standard candle is
simply some object whose intrinsic luminosity is known.  If you measure how
bright it appears to be to you and you know its intrinsic brightness, you
can figure out how far away it must be.

## Type Ia Supernovae

By far the most useful standard candle for cosmology has been the Type Ia
supernova (SN Ia).  SNe Ia are a class of supernova defined by a lack of
hydrogen and helium lines in their spectra and strong silicon lines.  They
are among the most luminous phenomena in the universe, usually exceeding the
luminosity of their host galaxy for a month or so around their peak
brightness.  Remarkably, all SN Ia appear to exhibit roughly the same
intrinsic luminosity.  There is a dispersion of only about two magnitudes
(about a factor of three in luminosity), and incredibly, this variation is
very tightly correlated with the time it takes the supernova to rise to peak
brightness.  If the rise time of the supernova is taken into account, the
intrinsic luminosity can be determined, and hence, the distance.  And
because SN Ia are so bright, they can be viewed across the universe, which
makes them ideal cosmological tools.

So then what are these incredible type Ia supernovae?  This, alas, is
unknown.  Due to the spectral features it is known that there is a white
dwarf involved.  But whether it is a white dwarf accreting matter from a
main sequence star or a red giant, or merging or even colliding with
another white dwarf is not known.  We will discuss the evidence for all
these scenarios (and a few more) in a future post. 

## The Evidence

The main program of SN Ia cosmology during much of the 1990s was determining
the correlation between the intrinsic luminosity and the rise time.
(Technically the rise time is called the "stretch factor".)  But once a
reliable way to determine intrinsic luminosities of SN Ia was established,
measuring the Hubble constant and deceleration parameter was relatively
easy.  All that was needed was a sample of SN Ia extended out to high
redshifts.  Even then, the necessary sample turned out not to be very large
--- Riess et al. (1998) only presented ten high-redshift supernovae, but
they were sufficient to detect the presence of dark energy to high
confidence.  

The main result of the Riess et al. paper is presented in this figure:

We have here the so-called Hubble diagram, a plot of distance vs.
recessional velocity, out to redshifts of almost 0.8.  We see in the top
panel how the universe would be expected to evolve in three fiducial models:
one with dark energy, and two without.  Of the two models without dark
energy, one is a low-matter universe and the other is a high matter
universe.  We see that the prediction for the dark energy model always lies
above both of the matter-only models.  This means that at any given distance
(or, equivalently, at any given time in the past) a universe filled with
dark energy is expanding more slowly than a matter-only universe.  This can
be interpreted the other way around as meaning that the expansion of
the universe is accelerating.  In other words, in order to get the observed
present-day expansion of the universe, an accelerating universe must have
been expanding more slowly in the past.

Residuals for the three models are shown in the bottom panel and it is clear
that the ten high redshift supernova all lie above the two matter-only
models.  There is a much better fit to the dark energy model. 

Of course, we don't have to try just three possible models.  We can try a
very large number of models with all sorts of different values of
$$\Omega\_{\Lambda}$$ and $$\Omega\_m$$ and see how likely it is that we
would have observed the data we have.  This would then tell us the relative
likelihoods of all the different models:
