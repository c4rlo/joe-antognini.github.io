Among the most important results in cosmology was the discovery at the tail
end of the twentieth century of the accelerating expansion of the universe.
This result implied that around 70% of the energy density of the universe
was composed of some exotic substance given the placeholder name "dark
energy."

Observational cosmology : the Hubble constant and the deceleration
parameter.  As it happens, both terms are misnomers.  The Hubble constant is
the rate of expansion today and has units of  (i.e., a fractional length per
unit time).
