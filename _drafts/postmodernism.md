When I was in college I took a course from a wonderful professor named XXX on
entitled "Postmodern History."  At the beginning of the course XXX asked us
what we wanted to learn when we enrolled in the course.  Personally, I was most
curious to know what, exactly, postmodern history *was*.  It turned out that
that's what everyone else in the .  Ten weeks later, we had read a number of
different texts, had a number intense discussions, written papers on different
topics, but I don't think any of us were really any closer to a clear
definition of what postmodern history was.  I certainly wasn't.

* Intellectual movements are ill-defined and have nebulous boundaries.
* Even individual people believe different things at different times.
  (Wittgenstein famously propounded two incompatible philosophies in his life.)
* With postmodernism, in particular, the movement is so recent and so near to
  us that we don't have the space of several centuries to discover its real
  essence.
* There are often works which are not popular in their day, but which come to
  be seen as better exemplars of the spirit of the times than more popular
  works.
    * (Or are there?  Maybe they just resonate more with us and our
      interpretation of those times)
* We are in the unfortunate position of being fish trying to perceive the water
  they swim in.
* Is it possible to adopt intellectual positions of another time?  It's hard
  enough to come up with something genuinely new, and bring into being
  something in the future.  But what about the past?  Is it all larping?
