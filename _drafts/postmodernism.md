When I was in college I took a course from a wonderful professor named Robert
Rosenstone on entitled "Postmodern History."  At the beginning of the course
Prof. Rosenstone asked us what we wanted to learn when we enrolled in the
course.  Personally, I was most curious to know what, exactly, postmodern
history *was*.  It turned out that that's what everyone else in the .  Ten
weeks later, we had read a number of different texts, had a number intense
discussions, written papers on different topics, but I don't think any of us
were really any closer to a clear definition of what postmodern history was.  I
certainly wasn't.

* Intellectual movements are ill-defined and have nebulous boundaries.
* Even individual people believe different things at different times.
  (Wittgenstein famously propounded two incompatible philosophies in his life.)
* With postmodernism, in particular, the movement is so recent and so near to
  us that we don't have the space of several centuries to discover its real
  essence.
* There are often works which are not popular in their day, but which come to
  be seen as better exemplars of the spirit of the times than more popular
  works.
    * (Or are there?  Maybe they just resonate more with us and our
      interpretation of those times)
* We are in the unfortunate position of being fish trying to perceive the water
  they swim in.
* Is it possible to adopt intellectual positions of another time?  It's hard
  enough to come up with something genuinely new, and bring into being
  something in the future.  But what about the past?  Is it all larping?

One of the main difficulties we have when trying to define an intellectual
movement like modernism or postmodernism is that the underlying impulses are so
deep that they are manifested in extremely disparate ways across different
disciplines.

Within a particular discipline, say, visual art, or music, it is much easier to
identify a cluster of works that possess sufficiently similar properties that
can justify grouping them together under the umbrella of a single movement.
These similarities span the superficial details of the works, to perhaps the
techniques used, and, ultimately, down to the underlying artistic goals that
the artists were pursuing, even if only subconsciously (although it seems to me
that artists are usually aware of what they are trying to do).

But when we start clustering works across disciplines, this becomes much more
difficult.  We no longer have any superficial similarities (or even if we can
intuit them, we should be suspicious that we are imposing these connections
simply due to the proximity of these works in space and time).  We cannot
compare the technical .  And oftentimes even the stated goals of the artists
are quite different.  So we have to go quite deep to find some pattern in the
mode of thought shared by these thousands of artists working across vastly
different disciplines and across decades, or even centuries.

* Example of Impressionism in art vs. music

Modernism: 
* form follows function
