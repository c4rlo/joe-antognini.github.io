## Dark energy's dark secret

I discussed in a [previous article][1] one of the most important discoveries
in all of astronomy --- the discovery of dark energy.  Key to this is an
accurate measurement of the distances and recessional velocities of distant
galaxies.  For this, cosmologists have used Type Ia supernovae.  

Type Ia supernovae are ideal for cosmological measurements.  They are
extremely bright, so they can be viewed at very large distances.  And even
more importantly, they are empirically observed to occur at the same
intrinsic luminosity (at least once a few corrections have been made).  This
means that when a Type Ia supernova is observed, one can determine how far
away it must be based on how bright it is observed to be.  There is one
problem with using Type Ia supernovae for cosmological measurements --- it
is not known what they are.

## What we do know about Type Ia supernovae


Strictly speaking, the Type Ia classification is a *spectroscopic*
classification.  It is important to note that the classification does not
really care what the supernova *is*, only on the spectral features it has.
A Type Ia supernova spectrum has the following characteristics:

1. No hydrogen lines in the spectrum
2. No helium lines in the spectrum
3. Silicon lines are present in the spectrum

And that is it.  Other supernova classes have different spectral lines in
their spectra.  Despite the fact that this classification scheme is not
based on what the supernova really *is*, it so happens that Type Ia
supernovae are physically quite different from other kinds of supernova,
which are collectively referred to as core-collapse supernovae.  Although
there are many open questions about core-collapse supernovae, the basic
picture is that core collapse supernovae occur when massive stars (at least
8 $M\_{\odot}$) run out of nuclear fuel to burn at the end of their lives.

## The double-degenerate hypothesis

## The triple scenario

## Other possibilities?
