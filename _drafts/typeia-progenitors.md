## Motivation

At this time it is well accepted that the expansion of the universe is
accelerating.  To account for this accelerated expansion, around 73% of the
energy density of the universe must be composed of some pervasive, exotic
material with negative pressure, generically termed "dark energy."  

One of the necessary ingredients for any sort of precision cosmology is
knowing the expansion history of the universe.  To measure the expansion
history of the universe, one must measure the recession velocities of
galaxies at different distances.  If the universe expands uniformly
throughout time, one will measure a linear relationship.  If gravitational
forces slow the expansion at later times one will measure that more distant
objects have more rapid recession velocitise than one would expect from
extrapolating a linear relationship.  Likewise, if (as we observe) dark
energy accelerates the expansion, more distant objects will have slower
recession velocities than one would expect from extrapolating a linear
relationship.

But the key to all of this is knowing how far away distant galaxies are.
