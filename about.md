I am the lead computational scientist at Persyst Development where I work on
developing seizure detection software.  In July 2017 I will be joining the
Google Brain Residency Program.  My background is in astronomy, where I
mostly studied the dynamics of few-body systems.  The hero images on this
website are from Burritt & Huntington's beautify 1856 celestial atlas.
