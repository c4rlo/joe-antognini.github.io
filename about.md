This website is dedicated to surveying the state of our knowledge of
astronomy.  Its purpose is to show what we do know and what we do not know,
and how we know what we know and how astronomers are trying to expand our
understanding of the skies.  The overarching goal is to present papers,
objects, concepts, and problems with which every astronomy ought to be
familiar. 

I plan on producing several regular features:

- **Outstanding problems** ---
    Each post will cover a particular open question -- what the problem is,
    what observations or calculations led to this problem, and an overview
    of possible solutions.  Relevant papers will be cited wherever possible.

- **Classic papers** --- Each post will summarize the work done in a
  classic, well-cited paper.  These will be papers that have a lasting
  impact on the field in some way, whether by discovering a new class of
  objects, solving an outstanding problem, providing a useful tool, or
  otherwise.  

- **Important objects** --- Each post will describe a famous (at least to
  some) object in the sky, what makes the object particularly interesting,
  what astronomers have learned from it in the past, and any outstanding
  problems associated with it.

- **The astronomer's toolkit** --- These posts will be more diverse.  These
  posts will cover some of the concepts, terms, techniques, and biases with
  which astronomers should be familiar.  There will additionally be some
  posts about software that is or should be in use by astronomers.   

- **Important telescopes & surveys** --- Each post will describe an
  important telescope or survey.  There will be a short history of the
  telescope or survey, the science need that it was meant to fill, a summary
  of the technical details of the telescope or survey, and some major
  scientific results that have come out of observations from the telescope
  or survey. 

- **The sky this month** --- This feature will appear once a month and will
  list everything an astronomer should know (but often doesn't) about what
  is going on in the sky this month.  It will always include the
  constellations that will be up, where the planets will be, and the phases
  of the moon.  If there are any eclipses, conjunctions, transits, meteor
  showers, equinoxes, solstices, or other such events, they will also be
  included.

More features may be added if I perceive myself writing several articles on
a similar theme.  Likewise, some features may disappear depending on how
they work in practice. 

This website grew out of a desire for me to deepen my understanding of
fields of astronomy that I do not directly do research in.  As such, I will
mostly be writing about subjects with which I am not intimately familiar.
Please keep in mind that I do not (yet) have a Ph.D. in astronomy.  Even if
I did, the field of astronomy is vast, so, like any other astronomer, I am
ignorant of, and perhaps even misinformed on, many issues.  I will correct
any mistakes that are brought to my attention, but not all mistakes will be
caught.  Read skeptically.

I am not yet sure what a sustainable frequency for new articles will be.  I
will write articles as frequently as my personal and work schedules allow, but
I do not expect to post new articles more than once per week.  The web is full
of enough content already; infrequent articles of higher quality will more
than make up for frequent articles of lesser quality.
