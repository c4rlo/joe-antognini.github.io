I am the lead computational scientist at Persyst Development where I work on
developing seizure detection software.  My background is in astronomy and
many of the topics covered on this website reflect this background
(including the header images of this website, which are from Burritt &
Huntington's beautiful 1856 celestial atlas).  In the final year of writing
my dissertation I became very interested in deep learning and transitioned
to work in that field rather than pursue a postdoc in astronomy.  The topics
on this website are therefore a mix of both astronomy and machine learning,
(though probably not both at the same time!).
