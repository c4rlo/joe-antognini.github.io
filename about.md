I am a machine learning engineer at [Whisper](https://whisper.ai) where we are
using deep learning to build a better hearing aid.  Before that I was a [Google
AI resident](/personal/ai-residency-reflections), and before that I was at
[Persyst](www.persyst.com), where we used deep learning to automate EEG and EKG
analysis.  My academic background is in astronomy, where I mostly studied the
dynamics of few-body systems.
